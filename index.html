        <b>The Mill on Central Avenue</b>
        <img src="the_mill.jpg">
        <br></br>
            The Mill won the Golden Spoon Award in 2016. This award is given
        to the best new restaurant in the entire state of Florida.
        The cuisine is a cross between Classical French and
        Rustic American.  The best examples of this are items
        such as meatloaf wellington or lamb shank pot pie.
        The meatloaf wellington is beef, pork, veal, and a mirepoix (carrots, celery, and onions)
        It is then coated with a housemade tomatoe sauce, wrapped with taleggio cheese, and philo dough.
        <br></br>
            The interior of the restaurant is made to look as the restuarant is named, a mill.
        Most everything, from the tables to the bathrooms, is used from refurbished local farm
        items.  The walls were designed by a local art phenom that helped to restor the 
        Sistine Chapel.
        <br></br>
            Whether you go there for the food, the ambience, or the classical, seasonal
        cocktails, you will never be disappointed. You should definitley try
        the paloma.  This cocktail has won numerous awards, such as the Best in The Bay.

        <b>The Oyster Bar</b>

        <br></br>
            The second place to go isn't far away. In fact, it is right across the street.  Obviously, it is
        known for the selection of oysters. On any given day, they can have at the bare 
        minimum of 4 to up to 8 different fresh oysters.
        <br></br>
            The best thing about this restaurant, besides the fresh oysters and local seafood
        offerend daily, is the Sunday brunch. From the hours of 10 am until 3 pm, for only $25 you 
        get an all you can eat buffet. Items on this insane spread include but not limited to fresh 
        carved prime rib, an omellete station, smoked salmon, fresh shrimp, and way
        to many more to list. Not only do you get that deal, you can also do a bottomless
        bloody mary and mimosa bar. It is serve yourself. Your server simply brings you a fresh glass
        and you can make your own cocktails to your liking along with a wide variety of garnishes.
        <br></br>
            If you do plan on trying to get in for lunch, you should try to get there as early as possible.
        The place tends to fill up within the first hour (outside and inside). People also like to sit at 
        their tables for the duration of brunch to get the best bang for their buck. A full menu is still 
        offered during this time and the rest of the week. Reservations should be made for the weekend, but 
        during the week it is fairly easy to get a table out front or in the dining room.

        <b>The Undertow</b>
        <img src="undertow.jpg">
        <br></br>
            Now we go out of downtown St. Pete to the beach, finally. If you are looking for a cheap dive bar,
        say no more. The Undertow has you covered with cheap basic drinks (even your frozen ones) along with plenty of 
        games to keep you entertained.
            This is one of the rare bars on the beach that allows you to park for free. This might seem like a 
        small thing, but it is great. Most places you go to make you pay at least $10 or more to pakr. If they don't 
        do that, you have to find a place on the street and feed that meter every 2 hours. (So annoying) 
        <br></br>
            While you sit there and sip your drink and eat your finger food, you can watch any sport on their 12 tv's.
        If you aren't into that, you can watch the two sand volleyball courts. There are usually highly competitive
        games going on or there are two man teams practicing. Maybe you want to get out there and play a little as well.
        They will let you borrow a ball at the bar. Getting too hot? Head to the Gulf. Just go about 30 feet
        and jump right in. Drink to much? Just get a room at the small hotel right above the bar. Just don't forget to stay
        for the "Green Flash." This happens right whne the sun disappears at sunset. Everyone stops and stares. Once it is finally
        done, there is a huge cheers and back to the partying.
